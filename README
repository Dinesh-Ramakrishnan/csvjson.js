csvjson.js is a simple JavaScript file to convert between CSV data and
JSON objects. It is released under the MIT License and fits under 1kb
when minified (even less when gzipped).

At the moment it doesn't have any support for parsing JSON strings, only
JSON style objects (you'll need to use JSON.js to work around that).
